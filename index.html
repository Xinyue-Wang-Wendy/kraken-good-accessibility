                    <p>For several days the Nautilus kept off from the American coast. Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of the sea of the Antilles. April 16th, we sighted Martinique and Guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles. I saw their tall peaks for an instant. The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his projects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous boats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened. Flight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to take possession of the boat without the Captain’s knowledge. But in the open sea it could not be thought of. The Canadian, Conseil, and I had a long conversation on this subject. For six months we had been prisoners on board the Nautilus. We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and, as Ned Land said, there was no reason why it should come to an end. We could hope nothing from the Captain of the Nautilus, but only from ourselves. Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more retired, less sociable. He seemed to shun me. I met him rarely. Formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he left me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon. What change had come over him? For what cause? For my part, I did not wish to bury with me my curious and novel studies. I had now the power to write the true book of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see daylight. The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas. There rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds. It was about eleven o’clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of large seaweeds.</p>
                    <p>“Well,” I said, “these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not be astonished to see some of these monsters.”</p>
                    <p>“What!” said Conseil; “cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod class?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” I said, “poulps of huge dimensions.”</p>
                    <p>“I will never believe that such animals exist,” said Ned.</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, “I remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by an octopus’s arm.”</p>
                    <p>“You saw that?” said the Canadian.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, Ned.”</p>
                    <p>“With your own eyes?”</p>
                    <p>“With my own eyes.”</p>
                    <p>“Where, pray, might that be?”</p>
